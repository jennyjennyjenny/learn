<h1>Welcome to the Internet!</h1>
<p>We'll start by learning the most basic of web development. Static HTML web pages. With a few scoops of javascript. It will give you enough of a taste of what the code life is about. If you like it, and want to make money, you'll need more skills. We'll start with the 4 basics though.</p>

<h2>Let's Build A Webbernet!</h2>
<p>There are four basic skills you've got to have to get hired for web development. It's the bare minimum.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2018">CSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Accessibility</a></li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>You're gonna learn them all while you build a little site.</p>


<h2>Possible Programmin Paths</h2>
<p>If you're into data at all. I'd imagine there's a lot of data viz / medical cross over going on somewhere. <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/python-programming/online" target="_blank">python</a></p>
<p>If you wanna go hardcore web development, you need more serious javascript training. To start, this is a good <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/javascript-development">course</a>. With those basics down, you can go ahead and teach yourself one of the frameworks like react, angular, whateves. But js is basically the wild west of languages so teaching yourself by looking at everyone else's code is ridiculously hard. I literally sucked at it for YEARS.  But you literally can't do front end if you can't jabbascrap. Dem's the breaks.</p>
